## First Impressions
As I was going through the tutorials on how to install ESLint and configure the IntelliJ preferences to use that standard, I thought to myself, how tedious! Why must we constantly go through the procedure of saving the three files into our project directories and installing the ESLint libraries? Isn't it okay to type our code the way that we are inclined to do? Do we need all our formatting to look that particular way? But then I remembered the same procedure we had to go through with installing Checkstyle while coding in Java in our 211 class. Undoubtedly, there is a particular reason why our professors are mandating that we install these utilities, and it is to benefit ourselves later on in the future as programmers. 

## The Actual Usefulness of Coding Standards
Even though it could be a pain to constantly configure the environment settings to accept the coding standards, tools like ESLint and Checkstyle are great ways to format our code to allow other developers to have an easier time reading and navigating through it. Coding standards save everyone much more time such that in a collaborative project, other programmers will know exactly what and where to look when solving a problem, thereby spending less time getting used to formatting that is different throughout. Not only that, these tools are our guidelines for improving our code and keeps an eye on bugs that could cause runtime errors or slow the program down. They are like the parents of programming, watching over us, and ensuring that our code is written most concisely and properly.   

## It Isn't as Bad as it Seems
Upon further tinkering with ESLint, the environment set-up started to become second nature. As I was getting used to this procedure, I started to enjoy the aspect of reaching that green checkmark at the end of writing our code. It can be satisfying because then I know that I've met all the code standards
