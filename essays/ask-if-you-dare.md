# Feel free to ask...on one condition 
We are always told to never be hesitant when asking questions, as questions are a definitive way to clarify one's understanding of things. However, this isn’t exactly to say for “dumb” questions, and Raymond's article gives a thorough explanation for this. While it is important to ask questions, it is also crucial that the question is formulated in the best possible way so that it could be helpful to not only ourselves but to other people in the community as well. Often, trivial questions could do us more harm than good and could even be aggravating for software engineers to look at. Formulating a question requires much thought and skill. One question alone could even alter a person's reputation. This not only applies to the field of computer science but everyday life as well.
