## What I think about ethics in software engineering:

A lot of the times, ethics is never a term that crosses the mind of early software engineers because they are too focused with functionality--that the program works and completes the task that was assigned. Being an undergraduate in Computer Science, I can truthfully say that the topic of ethics had never gone through my head, and this is because most of the lower division classes don't mention ethics, but rather the skill set and problem-solving that is needed in order to make a program. There is no denying the potential harm that any unrefined software could bring, even if it was unintentional. We want to analyze these situations, learn from these mistakes and always prepare for the worst. 

## Case Study: Harassment 
The Gamergate controversy of 2014 was an abominable campaign started by a community of trolls targeting prominent females, namely, game developers Zoe Quinn and Brianna Wu, and feminist media critic Anita Sarkeesian. These harassment campaigns went as far as to doxing, rape and death threats. When people can congregate anonymously and pounce upon victims, it is difficult to distinguish the perpetrators behind incriminating acts like these. Commentators also dismissed the situation, presuming it wasn't an ethical issue of concern, and in turn making it a low priority for authorities. Of course, no one took responsibility for this occurrence, and these hateful communities often denied the abuse they were inflicting on these women. 

Similarly, the case of The Serial Swatter took a 1000 hour worth of investigating on part of private detective B.A. Finley. The perpetrator took the name as "Obnoxious" and his actions were exactly what his pseudo name describes. The persistent amount of threats he had imposed on Twitch streamers--mostly women--shows his psychotic nature and how he receives pleasure from these actions. As a software engineer at Twitch, I would feel that my ethical obligation be to ensure the safety of all gamers and to inform all users that bullying is not to be tolerated and should be reported immediately.

In times like these, software engineers have a role--a role to ensure that no one is discriminated and that all people have a right in participation, (as stated in 1.4 of the Code of Ethics). The degree of harm that has resulted in Gamergate and The Serial Swatter was an instance of neglect on part of the moderators and developers. As a developer, they should always be monitoring and in the use of the software. in which they have failed to accomplish, resulting in the distress of innocent victims. It may seem obvious to know what is morally right and wrong, and most of the rules listed in the code of ethics are just a reiteration of what we learned as a child growing up, however, events like these are to reveal the nature of the lowest in human beings. Cyber bullying is an issue that should not be taken lightly. We never know what is to happen to these victims and the last thing we would want is to lose a precious life 

## Personal Opinion 
The lessons I have learned from this module are invaluable. ...... that means a functional program that will help our immediate stakeholder and the community as well.  It should be in everyone's interest and obligation to benefit and protect society with the programs that we create. The scenarios presented in this module are in fact very real in our day to day lives, and they allow us to reflect upon ourselves critically when writing code.
