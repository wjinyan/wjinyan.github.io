## Like that game
A couple of years ago, I was introduced to the game, Plague Inc., by my brother and I'd have to say, that game was addicting. It was surely a dark and eerie game.

Self-isolation at home has definitely taken a toll on the world. I have noticed a significant drop in my motivation and physical health. At first, I presumed that being in isolation was already my forte, but within the first week back from break, I was already sick of it.

Even though I can wake up later than usual, I'm starting to miss all the social interactions with my friends when we were able to go to school. With my friends in classes like Algorithms, I was more motivated to work on homework assignments because we are always supportive of each other and willing to help when the problems were difficult to understand.
