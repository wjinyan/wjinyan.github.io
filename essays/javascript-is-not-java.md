## Java Again?
Coming into this class, the only thing I knew about Javascript was that it is often used in responsive webpages and animations. I've also heard a word or two that web-browser games can also be developed with Javascript. When I found out that we were going to learn how to use it in this class, I figured that it would only be a reiteration of what we have already learned in our lower-division ICS classes. This was true as I was completing the starting exercises in FreeCodeCamp, as those were fairly straightforward. However, as I approached the ES6 portion, I was bewildered. Not only was I confused with the syntax, but I was also having difficulty grasping onto all the new features that supposedly made the code "easier" to read. There were countless times I had to resort to getting hints to complete the tasks at hand. Still, the structure of it is much like what we have learned in our past courses, i.e., object-oriented programming with classes and inheritance. Although I am not too familiar with Javascript, I can presume that from a software engineering perspective, Javascript is suitable for things like web and game development. This language could easily be picked up and includes features that other programming languages may not have at their disposal, such as the ability for a function to have more than one return type.

## The Pressure is on!
I was anxious and panicky the first time we were introduced to WODs. Being under a time constraint can, in no doubt, be intimidating for everyone. From the feedback received in the previous 314 classes, it seems viable that this is an effective strategy in improving students' competency in the field. This is indeed a great way to prepare undergraduates for job interviews and to get a feel of what it is like in an actual work setting. Time management is an essential skill, and it could be a make or break when trying to land an important job at an interview. Although completing problems in a limited timeframe can be very stressful and nerve-wracking, it is in my hopes that these WODs will get us used to handling pressure when faced with difficult challenges. 

## Keep Moving Onwards
Although learning a new language can be challenging, the best thing to do is to continue putting my utmost effort because eventually, the efforts will pay off. As I learn more about Javascript in the course, I hope I can put it to good use and implement it in my daily life for practical use and to possibly make things easier. Maybe it will guide me in my pursuits to developing a game.
