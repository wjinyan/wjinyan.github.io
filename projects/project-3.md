summary: A bank database program for ICS 212

<img class="ui image" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/cotton-header.png">

This user-friendly bank database program, developed using C and C++ utilizes pointers to access and remove information for targeted records in the database. Each record holds an account number, a name, and an address, and the records are sorted by account numbers from largest to smallest. 

Using what we have learned during the course, we have employed pointers to chain all the bank records together. 

From many encounters with segmentation faults, I have since learned that I am accessing information that is not supposed to be accessed, which would cause runtime errors. During the process of creating this project, I found that writing the pseudocode and working out the solution before typing the code on the computer has taught me to approach the problem in more of a cognizant manner, rather than constantly fixing the code on the computer because of a mindless attempt.
